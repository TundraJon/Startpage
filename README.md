## Status

Foundation in progress, per `homepage-build-spec-v7`:

- [x] Header (theme toggle, title, help/profile icons)
- [x] Search bar (Google/Bing toggle)
- [x] Home category (always-expanded bento layout, clock + weather widgets, core tiles)
- [x] Accordion category system (collapsible, multi-open, stripe-colored headers) with a few sample sections
- [ ] Weather widget wired to a live data source (currently placeholder data)
- [ ] Clock/weather long-press customization menus
- [ ] Add/edit tiles and categories (help walkthrough, drag/reorg, etc.)
- [ ] Personalization (colors, profile photo, per-device local storage of layout)

Theme and category expand/collapse state already persist per-device via `localStorage`.

## Build Log (completed)

Reported after reviewing the v8 pass live, built in the following pass.

- [x] Home category header bar: was rendering ~2x too tall — root cause was the `<h2>` tag's browser-default margin (not padding); normalized `.category-name` margin/font-size so it now matches the thin header height of every other category.
- [x] Clock widget: hour and minute digits doubled in size (1.9rem → 3.8rem).
- [x] Weather widget: current temperature number and condition emoji doubled in size (1.8rem → 3.6rem).
- [x] Weather widget: high temp shown in red, low temp shown in blue.
- [x] Weather widget: feels-like icon now switches direction — 🌡️ when feels-like is warmer than actual temp, 🌬️ when cooler.
- [x] Weather widget: the four bottom-row icon+number items (humidity, dew point, moon phase, UV) sized up 1.2x (0.7rem → 0.84rem).
- [x] Tiles: background switched from the off-white page background to pure white (`--surface`).
- [x] Tiles: added a border matching the Home header banner color (`--home-header-bg`) — same CSS variable as the banner, so it'll track automatically once Home color personalization is built.
- [x] Weather widget: background switched to pure white (`--surface`), same fix as the tiles.

## Build Log 2 (completed)

- [x] Clock widget: date stack (day-of-week, month, day-numeral) font size increased 1.3x (0.75rem → 0.975rem).
- [x] Weather widget: high, low, and feels-like text increased 1.2x, sharing a rule with the description text so both land at the same size (0.7rem → 0.84rem).
- [x] Weather widget: condition description text increased 1.2x, same rule as above.
- [x] Weather widget: sample condition text changed to "Light Thunderstorm".
- [x] Sample category tiles (News/Shopping/Entertainment): added a 5th tile to each — AP News, Costco, Hulu.
- [x] Home category's row-3 tiles: added a 5th tile (Google Calendar) alongside Gmail/Translate/Maps/USPS.
- [x] Weather widget: added a border matching the Home banner color (`--home-header-bg`), same treatment as the regular tiles.
- [x] Tile favicons: increased from 60% to 80% fill; tightened tile padding/gap (4px → 2px) so the label text still has room at the larger icon size.
- [x] Weather widget: top row (wind/visibility/cloud extras + location text) increased 1.2x (0.7rem → 0.84rem).
- [x] Clock widget: date stack swapped to static test values "Wednesday" / "September" / "20" (no longer live — the day/month were live-updating fields tied to `updateClock()`, now hardcoded so the long-form test values persist). **Result: it doesn't fit.** At the new 1.3x size, "Wednesday" and "September" both overflow the date column's width and wrap/clip against the widget's height — see screenshot state, this will need either an abbreviated form, a smaller font, or a wider date column once you've had a look.
- [x] Timezone pill: removed from the weather widget's top row; moved to the clock widget, centered under the displayed time (inside `.clock-face`, so it inherits the active color scheme via `currentColor`), font size matched to the AM/PM indicator (0.7rem).

## Build Log 3 (completed)

- [x] Clock widget restructured: digital time area (`.clock-face`) is now genuinely square (`aspect-ratio: 1/1`, sized to 78% of the widget's height, centered) instead of a 62%-width rectangle — verified in-browser at 147.7×147.7 equal width/height. This frees up space for a future analog face with the same footprint. Date stack reverted to abbreviated only ("Thu"/"Aug"/"20"), back to live-updating (short/long toggle and long-form idea dropped), font size back to 1x (0.75rem), shrunk to fit its content and pushed snug against the right edge (`margin-left: auto` + 6px padding). Verified the day-numeral is centered exactly under the month abbreviation (both measured at the same x-center in a live render).
- [x] Tile favicons: 80% → 75%.
- [x] Weather widget sample location changed to "Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, NM" — confirmed it wraps to two lines within its half of the top row without breaking layout.
- [x] Weather widget top row: restructured to a strict 50/50 split (`flex: 0 0 50%` each side) — extras above the temp, location (right-aligned) above the condition emoji.
- [x] Weather icons vs. text sizing split apart: each icon+value pair (top row and footer row) is now two separate elements, icon at 1.2x (`.wx-icon`) and value at 1x (`.wx-val`) — verified via computed styles (13.44px vs. 11.2px, exactly 1.2:1).
- [x] Weather sample condition text changed to WeatherAPI code 1201, "Moderate or heavy freezing rain" — confirmed it wraps to two lines at 1x without breaking the row.
- [x] Weather hi/low/feels-like + description row: reverted to 1x (0.7rem) — verified via computed style.
- [x] Category gaps replaced with a 1px hairline border (`border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border)`, no bottom border on the last category) instead of the old 10px margin — page is visibly more compact now, categories sit flush against each other.
- [~] Clock time-vs-pill vertical spacing: not separately tuned — the square-face restructure above changes this spacing as a side effect (face is now centered via `align-items: center` rather than stretched full-height), but I did not specifically verify it now sits "just a little over" the pill as asked. Worth a look on the live site — flag it again if the gap still isn't right and I'll adjust it directly rather than as a side effect of other changes.

## Build Log 4 (completed)

- [x] Weather widget bottom row: `.weather-hilo` and `.weather-desc` now each constrained to exactly 50% width (`flex: 0 0 50%`), description right-justified. Verified: hi/lo/feels-like now renders on a single line (13px tall, was 25px/double before) since it's no longer being squeezed to 34%; description wraps to two lines within its own half without affecting the other side.
- [x] Clock scheduling replaced: `setInterval(updateClock, 1000 * 10)` is gone. Now renders immediately on load, then computes ms-to-next-minute (`(60 - seconds) * 1000 - milliseconds`) and uses `setTimeout` to fire exactly on the minute boundary, rescheduling itself the same way each time (no drift-prone flat interval). Verified the ms-to-next-minute math against edge cases (:00.000 → 60000ms, :45.500 → 14500ms, :59.999 → 1ms) — all correct.

## Build Log 5 (completed)

- [x] Weather options menu — "Units & Core Info" section reordered to Temperature, Wind speed (unit), Wind Speed, Visibility, Cloud Cover %, Feels Like, Moon Phase, UV Index. Moon Phase moved here from "Visual Flourishes" (which now just holds Sunrise/Sunset Gradient and Live Condition Skin). Dropped the redundant word "display" from the three toggle labels. No JS/CSS changes needed — the toggle wiring is `data-toggle-setting`/`data-toggle` attribute-driven, not order-dependent, so this was a pure markup reorder. Verified the new row order and that the Moon Phase toggle still correctly hides its footer element from its new position.

### Weather Widget Phase 2 — build order item 1 (completed)

Resolved conflict: the spec's stacked wind/visibility/cloud layout **overrides** the previous horizontal build (confirmed with user 2026-08-20).

- [x] Top-left zone (wind/visibility/cloud): switched from horizontal to stacked — emoji on top, value below, three independent mini-columns (`.wx-stack`). Each independently toggleable; `[data-toggle]` + `hidden` attribute (with an explicit `.wx-stack[hidden]{display:none}` override, same fix pattern as the earlier help-overlay bug) — verified via computed styles.
- [x] Feels-like: only displays when the diff from actual temp is ±3°F or more (cold-case emoji 🌬️ already matched the spec, no change needed there). Verified: hides/shows correctly via the toggle, and the sample data (diff of 4°F) correctly shows.
- [x] Long-press options menu built: 3 sections in the spec's order (Units & Core Info, Safety, Visual Flourishes), all 11 controls, opened via a custom long-press gesture (pointerdown + 550ms hold, cancels on move/release) rather than the browser's native context menu. All settings persist to `localStorage` (`weatherSettings`) and were verified to survive a full page reload.
- [x] Temperature unit tap-vs-persistent split: long-press menu F/C selection is the persistent default (saved + reapplied on load); tapping the °F/°C symbol directly is a temporary peek that does not touch the stored setting. Verified directly: tapped to peek at °C, then opened the long-press menu — it still showed °F as the active/persistent selection, confirming the two are properly decoupled.
- [x] Wind speed MPH/KPH: added as a persistent menu setting (source value stored in mph, converted for display) — not explicitly required for item 1 but natural to include alongside the temp unit work since it follows the identical pattern.

## Build Log 6 (completed)

### Clock Widget Phase 2 (from `clock-widget-phase2-spec`)

No conflicts with existing implementation at the time this was reviewed. One genuine internal contradiction *within the spec itself* on 24hr face orientation ("6/18 sit at horizontal left/right" vs. "6 sits at the bottom") — resolved with the user: **24 at top, 12 at bottom, 6 at right, 18 at left** (matches the math for 24 evenly-spaced positions, the ASCII diagram's left/right row, and how real 24-hour accessibility clocks like the Chicago Lighthouse reference are actually laid out).

- [x] Long-press menu on the clock widget (`attachLongPress` — refactored out of the weather widget's identical implementation into a shared helper, both now use it): Digital/Analog segmented selector plus an always-visible live preview area below it — 4 color-scheme swatches (each a small live-updating digital clock) when Digital is selected, or a single live analog face preview when Analog is selected. Selecting an option applies immediately (same instant-apply pattern as the weather menu) and updates the preview so you can see the result without closing the modal.
- [x] 12hr/24hr toggle, shared between modes: in digital, adds/removes the AM/PM indicator; in analog, switches face geometry. Both settings persist to `localStorage` (`clockSettings`) — verified surviving a full reload.
- [x] Analog 12hr face: white background, hour + minute hands, ticks at all 12 positions, only 3/6/9/12 printed, no shading. Rendered via SVG, generated in JS (`renderAnalogFace`).
- [x] Analog 24hr face: outer ring white throughout with 24 ticks + 6/12/18/24 numerals; inner circle split along the horizontal 6–18 axis, gray top / white bottom; hour hand at half speed (one rotation per 24h), minute hand normal. Verified precisely at a mocked midnight (00:00) — hour hand renders pointing exactly to the top (the 24 position), confirming both the orientation and the rotation math are correct.
- [x] Fixed a real browser bug hit along the way: setting `.hidden = false` on an `<svg>` element updates the IDL property but does **not** reliably remove the actual `hidden` content attribute in this Chromium build (confirmed via isolated test — the property read back `false` while `getAttribute('hidden')` still returned `""`). Since the CSS visibility rule targets the attribute via `[hidden]`, this silently kept the analog face invisible even though the "hidden" property said otherwise. Fixed by using explicit `setAttribute('hidden','')`/`removeAttribute('hidden')` for the SVG element specifically, rather than relying on the `.hidden` property.
- [x] Digital mode layout confirmed unchanged/correct, per the spec's own note that this section just restates what's already built.

## Build Log 7 (completed)

### Analog clock follow-ups

- [x] Analog face background: added `--clock-analog-frame` (light: `var(--bg)`, dark: `#3a3f45`, a real visible gray, not the page's near-black `--bg`) — only the circular face itself is white now, the square frame around it follows theme. Verified via computed style: light theme frame = `rgb(242,242,242)` (matches `--bg` exactly), dark theme = `rgb(58,63,69)` (the new dark gray, not white, not near-black).
- [x] 24hr face, dark theme: added `--clock-analog-night` (light: `#c9c9c9`, dark: `#1a1a1a`), read at render time and applied to the inner circle's shaded top half. Verified: renders `#1a1a1a` in dark theme.
- [x] Numeral placement moved inward on both faces to clear the tick marks — 12hr numerals r=34→28, 24hr numerals r=41→37.5 (the old value was sitting exactly on the tick's inner edge, a direct collision; the new value clears both the tick ring and the inner circle's own edge at r=34).

### Digital clock overflow bug + black-white redesign

- [x] Fixed the digit overflow: hour/minute font size reduced 3.8rem → 3rem. Verified across all 4 schemes — overflow went from +11.2px (past the face's edge) to -2.2px (comfortable margin to spare) on both top and bottom.
- [x] Black-white scheme redesigned per the user's sketch: the face now stays black like every other scheme; only a white rounded box (`.clock-digits`) hugs the hour+minute digits specifically. AM/PM and the EDT pill render light-on-black outside that patch, matching the other 3 schemes. Verified via computed style: face background black, digits-patch background white, AM/PM color white.

### Weather Widget Phase 2 — build order item 3 (visual flourishes, built with placeholder data)

Geolocation, true local timezone, and the full live data pull stay queued below — those need the actual WeatherAPI.com integration, which doesn't exist yet. Everything below was buildable now using the existing placeholder weather data (same approach as the rest of this widget).

- [x] Bottom row (humidity/dew point/moon/UV) wrapped in `.weather-footer-row` with a reserved `min-height`, so it holds its space rather than collapsing — verified non-zero height with items toggled off. Note: humidity and dew point don't actually have on/off toggles in the spec's 11-item long-press menu (only Moon Phase and UV do, per the menu structure in section 2 of the spec) — so "all 4 off" can't fully happen with the current control set, but the space-reservation mechanism itself is built and verified correct for whichever items are actually toggleable.
- [x] Severe Weather Alerts scrolling ticker: replaces the bottom row's space when active, loops via CSS marquee animation, dismissible by tap. Dismissal state (`weatherAlertState` in `localStorage`) tracks alert ID + timestamp — verified the full cycle: shows on load, dismiss hides it and persists the dismissal, and the 2-hour reappearance logic is in place (`shouldShowAlert()` re-arms once `Date.now() - dismissedAt >= 2h`). Built against one sample placeholder alert since there's no live alerts feed yet.
- [x] Sunrise/sunset gradient: implemented the exact v8 keyframe/interpolation logic (45-min-each-side twilight window, separate sunrise/sunset keyframe tables, linear RGB lerp between nearest keyframes) using placeholder sunrise (6:30am) / sunset (7:45pm) times. Verified the math precisely against the spec formula at three points — noon (flat `#4a90e2`/`#d1e8ff`, full day), 2am (flat `#020617`, deep night), and mid-sunset (computed RGB matched the hand-worked formula exactly, e.g. top `rgb(65,127,201)`). Initial version was technically correct but visually invisible (opaque row backgrounds fully hid it) — fixed by switching the row backgrounds to semi-transparent (`rgba(var(--surface-rgb), 0.82)`), which lets the gradient read clearly while keeping text readable, checked at the darkest case (deep night).
- [x] Live Condition Skin (cloud-cover-driven part): gray overlay opacity = cloud% ÷ 2, floating cloud emoji count = cloud% ÷ 10, each randomized 1x–2x size with speed scaling to size — verified against placeholder cloud data (20% → 0.1 opacity, 2 clouds). Renders behind all text content (`z-index: -1`) so it never affects readability. The condition-specific base animations (rain/snow/thunderstorm/etc., separate from the cloud-cover math) are not built — the spec gives no specifics there beyond "implementer has creative latitude," so that part is left for a dedicated follow-up rather than guessing at a design.

## Build Log 8 (completed)

### Analog clock corrections

- [x] Frame color fixed to flat `var(--clock-bg)` (black) always, both themes, both faces — the theme-aware `--clock-analog-frame` variable from Log 7 was removed. Verified: `rgb(0,0,0)` in both light and dark theme.
- [x] 12hr numerals reverted to r=34 (undoing the accidental r=28 move). Verified: "3" numeral now renders at x=84 (cx 50 + r 34), matching the original position exactly. 24hr numerals stay at r=37.5.
- [x] 24hr dark-theme contrast fixed: added `--clock-analog-day` (light `#fff`, dark `#8a8a8a`) and changed `--clock-analog-night` to dark `#4a4a4a` (was `#1a1a1a`, nearly identical to the `#222` hand color). Both the outer ring/12hr face and the 24hr inner circle's day-half now use `--clock-analog-day`, so the whole dark-theme face reads as appropriately gray rather than staying stark white, while the hands stay clearly visible against both halves — checked visually with the hands actually rendered on top, not just as flat swatches.

### Clock: timezone pill

- [x] Moved out of `.clock-digital` (which disappears in analog mode) into a new `.clock-date-stack` wrapper alongside the day/month/day-number, anchored to the bottom of the date column via `justify-content: space-between` on `.clock-date`. Now visible in both digital and analog modes — verified in both.

### Long-press modals: native text-selection bug

- [x] Fixed: extended `user-select: none` / `-webkit-touch-callout: none` / `touch-action: manipulation` to `.help-panel` (shared by all three overlays — help, clock options, weather options), not just the widgets themselves. Verified via computed style (`user-select: none` on the panel).

### Weather widget: corrected layer stack + testing panel

- [x] **Real bug found and fixed along the way:** the layer-stack correction initially had all the right computed styles (skin background, opacity, z-index all verified correct in the DOM) but rendered completely invisible — a plain white card regardless of settings. Root cause: `.weather-widget` had `position: relative` but no explicit `z-index`, so it never actually established its own stacking context; `.weather-skin`'s `z-index: -1` was resolving against some distant ancestor's stacking context instead of being scoped locally, placing it behind unrelated page content. Fixed by adding `z-index: 0` to `.weather-widget`. Re-verified visually after the fix — the gradient is now genuinely visible.
- [x] Removed the per-row opaque/semi-transparent scrims (`.weather-top`, `.weather-middle`, etc. no longer have their own background) — replaced with the correct 5-layer stack: white base (`.weather-widget`'s own background, now toggleable) → sky gradient (`.weather-skin`, opacity-controlled) → cloud cover (overlay + drifting clouds, already layered inside `.weather-skin`) → *(weather effects — not built, per item 5, left alone)* → data (text/icons, always topmost, no longer needs its own background to stay readable).
- [x] Testing panel built (`🧪 Testing Panel` button at the bottom of the page, clearly marked temporary): time override (scrub any time of day to preview the gradient), cloud % slider, white-background toggle, gradient opacity slider, and a text-outline toggle (medium gray, the readability idea from the last message) — all wired to `renderWeatherSkin()` and verified live: time override to 2am produces the exact flat `#020617` night color; white-bg off + opacity slider all confirmed via computed style; cloud slider at 80% produces exactly 8 clouds at 0.4 overlay opacity (matches the cloud%÷10 and cloud%÷2 formulas exactly).
- [x] Used the finished tool to actually look at the worst case (white bg off, night colors) — confirmed the readability problem is real: some text stays visible, some effectively disappears against near-black. This was expected and is intentionally *not* fixed in this pass — item 5 (condition-specific effects) and the broader text-color question are still open, now something that can actually be evaluated instead of guessed at.

## Build Queue

Not yet implemented — queued for whenever it's relevant. All blocked on the same thing: the live WeatherAPI.com integration doesn't exist yet, this widget is still entirely placeholder data.

- [ ] 15-minute staleness-based weather refresh (cache fetch + timestamp in `localStorage`, refetch only when ≥15 min stale).
- [ ] Geolocation: `navigator.geolocation` for real coordinates (must work globally, not US-only), with a sensible fallback if access is declined.
- [ ] Timezone abbreviation: true local timezone of the detected location via WeatherAPI's `location.tz_id`, never UTC/device-home, UTC-offset fallback only if no standard abbreviation applies.
- [ ] Full live data pull: feels-like, wind, visibility, cloud cover, humidity, dew point, UV, moon phase (all 8 phases), sunrise/sunset, severe alerts, hourly forecast via `/forecast.json?days=1&alerts=yes`.
- [ ] Condition-specific base animations for Live Condition Skin (rain/snow/thunderstorm/clear day/cloudy/clear night) — the cloud-cover math is built, per-condition visual treatments aren't. Now that the testing panel exists, the night-readability problem (unreadable text against a dominant dark gradient) is also worth solving properly around whenever this is tackled — likely gradient-aware text color and/or the text-stroke idea, evaluated live via the testing panel rather than guessed at.

### Clock widget: timezone pill anchoring (correction)

- [ ] The Build Log 8 fix anchored the pill to the bottom of `.clock-date` via `justify-content: space-between`, which only pins it to the bottom of the narrow date column, not the widget. Needs to instead anchor to the bottom-right corner of `.clock-widget` itself, visually separated/detached from `.clock-date-stack` (not flush against it) — sitting down at the widget's own outer bottom-right edge, independent of the date column's height. Likely means taking the pill out of the `.clock-date` flow (`position: absolute` on `.clock-widget`, which already needs `position: relative` set) rather than relying on flex alignment within `.clock-date`.

### Clock widget: missing border

- [ ] `.clock-widget` has no border, unlike `.tile` and `.weather-widget` which both have `border: 1px solid var(--home-header-bg)`. Add the same `1px solid var(--home-header-bg)` border to `.clock-widget` for visual consistency across all three.

### ~~Weather widget: cloud overlay / drifting clouds not rendering~~ (not a bug — confirmed)

- [x] Root cause confirmed by user: the "Live Condition Skin" toggle in Weather Options was simply off. No code issue, nothing to build.

### Weather widget: cloud layer distribution (height-correlated size + speed)

- [ ] Clouds should only occupy the **top 50%** of the widget — change `.wx-skin-cloud`'s `top` random range from the current `10% + random*60%` (10%–70%) to `0%–50%`.
- [ ] Size and speed should no longer be randomized independently of position — both should derive from where the cloud sits vertically within that top-50% band:
  - At the **top edge** (`top: 0%`): size **2.5x**, this is the largest and fastest.
  - At the **middle** (`top: 50%`, the band's bottom edge): size **1x**, this is the smallest and slowest.
  - Clouds in between get intermediate size/speed, linearly interpolated by vertical position.
- [ ] Speed recalibration: current largest-cloud speed is correct and should be preserved as the anchor for the new top-edge/2.5x case (currently `baseDurationSec(34) / size`, which at the old max size 2 gives 17s — keep 17s as the duration for the new largest/2.5x/top-edge clouds). The smallest/1x/middle clouds should take exactly **60s** to cross the widget (user's explicit correction — not 68s as first estimated from "about 2x too fast").
  - Linear mapping (two anchor points: size 2.5→17s, size 1→60s): with `f = topPct / 50` (0 at top edge, 1 at middle), `size = 2.5 - 1.5*f` and `duration = 17 + 43*f` seconds.
- [ ] Cloud count formula (`round(cloudPct / 10)`) and horizontal drift (`left: -15% → 115%`) are unaffected and should stay as-is.

### New feature: automatic theme switching by local time

- [ ] Auto-switch `data-theme` based on the device's local time: 7:00 AM–7:00 PM → light/day theme, 7:00 PM–7:00 AM → dark/night theme, transitioning exactly at the 7:00 boundary (not gradually). Must be opt-in, not the forced default — needs a new toggle setting. No global/site-wide settings surface currently exists (only the per-widget Clock Options and Weather Options long-press menus), so this needs a new home — likely a new settings entry point, or folding it into the existing theme-toggle button's behavior (e.g. long-press it to reveal an "auto" option) rather than building a whole new settings surface just for one toggle. When enabled, presumably needs a scheduled re-check (similar pattern to `scheduleNextClockTick()`) so the switch actually fires at 7:00 without requiring a page reload, and should defer to/override the manual toggle appropriately (open question: does manually toggling while auto-mode is on disable auto-mode, or get overridden at the next boundary?).
