## Status

Foundation in progress, per `homepage-build-spec-v7`:

- [x] Header (theme toggle, title, help/profile icons)
- [x] Search bar (Google/Bing toggle)
- [x] Home category (always-expanded bento layout, clock + weather widgets, core tiles)
- [x] Accordion category system (collapsible, multi-open, stripe-colored headers) with a few sample sections
- [ ] Weather widget wired to a live data source (currently placeholder data)
- [ ] Clock/weather long-press customization menus
- [ ] Add/edit tiles and categories (help walkthrough, drag/reorg, etc.)
- [ ] Personalization (colors, profile photo, per-device local storage of layout)

Theme and category expand/collapse state already persist per-device via `localStorage`.

## Build Log (completed)

Reported after reviewing the v8 pass live, built in the following pass.

- [x] Home category header bar: was rendering ~2x too tall — root cause was the `<h2>` tag's browser-default margin (not padding); normalized `.category-name` margin/font-size so it now matches the thin header height of every other category.
- [x] Clock widget: hour and minute digits doubled in size (1.9rem → 3.8rem).
- [x] Weather widget: current temperature number and condition emoji doubled in size (1.8rem → 3.6rem).
- [x] Weather widget: high temp shown in red, low temp shown in blue.
- [x] Weather widget: feels-like icon now switches direction — 🌡️ when feels-like is warmer than actual temp, 🌬️ when cooler.
- [x] Weather widget: the four bottom-row icon+number items (humidity, dew point, moon phase, UV) sized up 1.2x (0.7rem → 0.84rem).
- [x] Tiles: background switched from the off-white page background to pure white (`--surface`).
- [x] Tiles: added a border matching the Home header banner color (`--home-header-bg`) — same CSS variable as the banner, so it'll track automatically once Home color personalization is built.
- [x] Weather widget: background switched to pure white (`--surface`), same fix as the tiles.

## Build Log 2 (completed)

- [x] Clock widget: date stack (day-of-week, month, day-numeral) font size increased 1.3x (0.75rem → 0.975rem).
- [x] Weather widget: high, low, and feels-like text increased 1.2x, sharing a rule with the description text so both land at the same size (0.7rem → 0.84rem).
- [x] Weather widget: condition description text increased 1.2x, same rule as above.
- [x] Weather widget: sample condition text changed to "Light Thunderstorm".
- [x] Sample category tiles (News/Shopping/Entertainment): added a 5th tile to each — AP News, Costco, Hulu.
- [x] Home category's row-3 tiles: added a 5th tile (Google Calendar) alongside Gmail/Translate/Maps/USPS.
- [x] Weather widget: added a border matching the Home banner color (`--home-header-bg`), same treatment as the regular tiles.
- [x] Tile favicons: increased from 60% to 80% fill; tightened tile padding/gap (4px → 2px) so the label text still has room at the larger icon size.
- [x] Weather widget: top row (wind/visibility/cloud extras + location text) increased 1.2x (0.7rem → 0.84rem).
- [x] Clock widget: date stack swapped to static test values "Wednesday" / "September" / "20" (no longer live — the day/month were live-updating fields tied to `updateClock()`, now hardcoded so the long-form test values persist). **Result: it doesn't fit.** At the new 1.3x size, "Wednesday" and "September" both overflow the date column's width and wrap/clip against the widget's height — see screenshot state, this will need either an abbreviated form, a smaller font, or a wider date column once you've had a look.
- [x] Timezone pill: removed from the weather widget's top row; moved to the clock widget, centered under the displayed time (inside `.clock-face`, so it inherits the active color scheme via `currentColor`), font size matched to the AM/PM indicator (0.7rem).

## Build Log 3 (completed)

- [x] Clock widget restructured: digital time area (`.clock-face`) is now genuinely square (`aspect-ratio: 1/1`, sized to 78% of the widget's height, centered) instead of a 62%-width rectangle — verified in-browser at 147.7×147.7 equal width/height. This frees up space for a future analog face with the same footprint. Date stack reverted to abbreviated only ("Thu"/"Aug"/"20"), back to live-updating (short/long toggle and long-form idea dropped), font size back to 1x (0.75rem), shrunk to fit its content and pushed snug against the right edge (`margin-left: auto` + 6px padding). Verified the day-numeral is centered exactly under the month abbreviation (both measured at the same x-center in a live render).
- [x] Tile favicons: 80% → 75%.
- [x] Weather widget sample location changed to "Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, NM" — confirmed it wraps to two lines within its half of the top row without breaking layout.
- [x] Weather widget top row: restructured to a strict 50/50 split (`flex: 0 0 50%` each side) — extras above the temp, location (right-aligned) above the condition emoji.
- [x] Weather icons vs. text sizing split apart: each icon+value pair (top row and footer row) is now two separate elements, icon at 1.2x (`.wx-icon`) and value at 1x (`.wx-val`) — verified via computed styles (13.44px vs. 11.2px, exactly 1.2:1).
- [x] Weather sample condition text changed to WeatherAPI code 1201, "Moderate or heavy freezing rain" — confirmed it wraps to two lines at 1x without breaking the row.
- [x] Weather hi/low/feels-like + description row: reverted to 1x (0.7rem) — verified via computed style.
- [x] Category gaps replaced with a 1px hairline border (`border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border)`, no bottom border on the last category) instead of the old 10px margin — page is visibly more compact now, categories sit flush against each other.
- [~] Clock time-vs-pill vertical spacing: not separately tuned — the square-face restructure above changes this spacing as a side effect (face is now centered via `align-items: center` rather than stretched full-height), but I did not specifically verify it now sits "just a little over" the pill as asked. Worth a look on the live site — flag it again if the gap still isn't right and I'll adjust it directly rather than as a side effect of other changes.

## Build Log 4 (completed)

- [x] Weather widget bottom row: `.weather-hilo` and `.weather-desc` now each constrained to exactly 50% width (`flex: 0 0 50%`), description right-justified. Verified: hi/lo/feels-like now renders on a single line (13px tall, was 25px/double before) since it's no longer being squeezed to 34%; description wraps to two lines within its own half without affecting the other side.
- [x] Clock scheduling replaced: `setInterval(updateClock, 1000 * 10)` is gone. Now renders immediately on load, then computes ms-to-next-minute (`(60 - seconds) * 1000 - milliseconds`) and uses `setTimeout` to fire exactly on the minute boundary, rescheduling itself the same way each time (no drift-prone flat interval). Verified the ms-to-next-minute math against edge cases (:00.000 → 60000ms, :45.500 → 14500ms, :59.999 → 1ms) — all correct.

## Build Log 5 (completed)

- [x] Weather options menu — "Units & Core Info" section reordered to Temperature, Wind speed (unit), Wind Speed, Visibility, Cloud Cover %, Feels Like, Moon Phase, UV Index. Moon Phase moved here from "Visual Flourishes" (which now just holds Sunrise/Sunset Gradient and Live Condition Skin). Dropped the redundant word "display" from the three toggle labels. No JS/CSS changes needed — the toggle wiring is `data-toggle-setting`/`data-toggle` attribute-driven, not order-dependent, so this was a pure markup reorder. Verified the new row order and that the Moon Phase toggle still correctly hides its footer element from its new position.

### Weather Widget Phase 2 — build order item 1 (completed)

Resolved conflict: the spec's stacked wind/visibility/cloud layout **overrides** the previous horizontal build (confirmed with user 2026-08-20).

- [x] Top-left zone (wind/visibility/cloud): switched from horizontal to stacked — emoji on top, value below, three independent mini-columns (`.wx-stack`). Each independently toggleable; `[data-toggle]` + `hidden` attribute (with an explicit `.wx-stack[hidden]{display:none}` override, same fix pattern as the earlier help-overlay bug) — verified via computed styles.
- [x] Feels-like: only displays when the diff from actual temp is ±3°F or more (cold-case emoji 🌬️ already matched the spec, no change needed there). Verified: hides/shows correctly via the toggle, and the sample data (diff of 4°F) correctly shows.
- [x] Long-press options menu built: 3 sections in the spec's order (Units & Core Info, Safety, Visual Flourishes), all 11 controls, opened via a custom long-press gesture (pointerdown + 550ms hold, cancels on move/release) rather than the browser's native context menu. All settings persist to `localStorage` (`weatherSettings`) and were verified to survive a full page reload.
- [x] Temperature unit tap-vs-persistent split: long-press menu F/C selection is the persistent default (saved + reapplied on load); tapping the °F/°C symbol directly is a temporary peek that does not touch the stored setting. Verified directly: tapped to peek at °C, then opened the long-press menu — it still showed °F as the active/persistent selection, confirming the two are properly decoupled.
- [x] Wind speed MPH/KPH: added as a persistent menu setting (source value stored in mph, converted for display) — not explicitly required for item 1 but natural to include alongside the temp unit work since it follows the identical pattern.

## Build Log 6 (completed)

### Clock Widget Phase 2 (from `clock-widget-phase2-spec`)

No conflicts with existing implementation at the time this was reviewed. One genuine internal contradiction *within the spec itself* on 24hr face orientation ("6/18 sit at horizontal left/right" vs. "6 sits at the bottom") — resolved with the user: **24 at top, 12 at bottom, 6 at right, 18 at left** (matches the math for 24 evenly-spaced positions, the ASCII diagram's left/right row, and how real 24-hour accessibility clocks like the Chicago Lighthouse reference are actually laid out).

- [x] Long-press menu on the clock widget (`attachLongPress` — refactored out of the weather widget's identical implementation into a shared helper, both now use it): Digital/Analog segmented selector plus an always-visible live preview area below it — 4 color-scheme swatches (each a small live-updating digital clock) when Digital is selected, or a single live analog face preview when Analog is selected. Selecting an option applies immediately (same instant-apply pattern as the weather menu) and updates the preview so you can see the result without closing the modal.
- [x] 12hr/24hr toggle, shared between modes: in digital, adds/removes the AM/PM indicator; in analog, switches face geometry. Both settings persist to `localStorage` (`clockSettings`) — verified surviving a full reload.
- [x] Analog 12hr face: white background, hour + minute hands, ticks at all 12 positions, only 3/6/9/12 printed, no shading. Rendered via SVG, generated in JS (`renderAnalogFace`).
- [x] Analog 24hr face: outer ring white throughout with 24 ticks + 6/12/18/24 numerals; inner circle split along the horizontal 6–18 axis, gray top / white bottom; hour hand at half speed (one rotation per 24h), minute hand normal. Verified precisely at a mocked midnight (00:00) — hour hand renders pointing exactly to the top (the 24 position), confirming both the orientation and the rotation math are correct.
- [x] Fixed a real browser bug hit along the way: setting `.hidden = false` on an `<svg>` element updates the IDL property but does **not** reliably remove the actual `hidden` content attribute in this Chromium build (confirmed via isolated test — the property read back `false` while `getAttribute('hidden')` still returned `""`). Since the CSS visibility rule targets the attribute via `[hidden]`, this silently kept the analog face invisible even though the "hidden" property said otherwise. Fixed by using explicit `setAttribute('hidden','')`/`removeAttribute('hidden')` for the SVG element specifically, rather than relying on the `.hidden` property.
- [x] Digital mode layout confirmed unchanged/correct, per the spec's own note that this section just restates what's already built.

## Build Log 7 (completed)

### Analog clock follow-ups

- [x] Analog face background: added `--clock-analog-frame` (light: `var(--bg)`, dark: `#3a3f45`, a real visible gray, not the page's near-black `--bg`) — only the circular face itself is white now, the square frame around it follows theme. Verified via computed style: light theme frame = `rgb(242,242,242)` (matches `--bg` exactly), dark theme = `rgb(58,63,69)` (the new dark gray, not white, not near-black).
- [x] 24hr face, dark theme: added `--clock-analog-night` (light: `#c9c9c9`, dark: `#1a1a1a`), read at render time and applied to the inner circle's shaded top half. Verified: renders `#1a1a1a` in dark theme.
- [x] Numeral placement moved inward on both faces to clear the tick marks — 12hr numerals r=34→28, 24hr numerals r=41→37.5 (the old value was sitting exactly on the tick's inner edge, a direct collision; the new value clears both the tick ring and the inner circle's own edge at r=34).

### Digital clock overflow bug + black-white redesign

- [x] Fixed the digit overflow: hour/minute font size reduced 3.8rem → 3rem. Verified across all 4 schemes — overflow went from +11.2px (past the face's edge) to -2.2px (comfortable margin to spare) on both top and bottom.
- [x] Black-white scheme redesigned per the user's sketch: the face now stays black like every other scheme; only a white rounded box (`.clock-digits`) hugs the hour+minute digits specifically. AM/PM and the EDT pill render light-on-black outside that patch, matching the other 3 schemes. Verified via computed style: face background black, digits-patch background white, AM/PM color white.

### Weather Widget Phase 2 — build order item 3 (visual flourishes, built with placeholder data)

Geolocation, true local timezone, and the full live data pull stay queued below — those need the actual WeatherAPI.com integration, which doesn't exist yet. Everything below was buildable now using the existing placeholder weather data (same approach as the rest of this widget).

- [x] Bottom row (humidity/dew point/moon/UV) wrapped in `.weather-footer-row` with a reserved `min-height`, so it holds its space rather than collapsing — verified non-zero height with items toggled off. Note: humidity and dew point don't actually have on/off toggles in the spec's 11-item long-press menu (only Moon Phase and UV do, per the menu structure in section 2 of the spec) — so "all 4 off" can't fully happen with the current control set, but the space-reservation mechanism itself is built and verified correct for whichever items are actually toggleable.
- [x] Severe Weather Alerts scrolling ticker: replaces the bottom row's space when active, loops via CSS marquee animation, dismissible by tap. Dismissal state (`weatherAlertState` in `localStorage`) tracks alert ID + timestamp — verified the full cycle: shows on load, dismiss hides it and persists the dismissal, and the 2-hour reappearance logic is in place (`shouldShowAlert()` re-arms once `Date.now() - dismissedAt >= 2h`). Built against one sample placeholder alert since there's no live alerts feed yet.
- [x] Sunrise/sunset gradient: implemented the exact v8 keyframe/interpolation logic (45-min-each-side twilight window, separate sunrise/sunset keyframe tables, linear RGB lerp between nearest keyframes) using placeholder sunrise (6:30am) / sunset (7:45pm) times. Verified the math precisely against the spec formula at three points — noon (flat `#4a90e2`/`#d1e8ff`, full day), 2am (flat `#020617`, deep night), and mid-sunset (computed RGB matched the hand-worked formula exactly, e.g. top `rgb(65,127,201)`). Initial version was technically correct but visually invisible (opaque row backgrounds fully hid it) — fixed by switching the row backgrounds to semi-transparent (`rgba(var(--surface-rgb), 0.82)`), which lets the gradient read clearly while keeping text readable, checked at the darkest case (deep night).
- [x] Live Condition Skin (cloud-cover-driven part): gray overlay opacity = cloud% ÷ 2, floating cloud emoji count = cloud% ÷ 10, each randomized 1x–2x size with speed scaling to size — verified against placeholder cloud data (20% → 0.1 opacity, 2 clouds). Renders behind all text content (`z-index: -1`) so it never affects readability. The condition-specific base animations (rain/snow/thunderstorm/etc., separate from the cloud-cover math) are not built — the spec gives no specifics there beyond "implementer has creative latitude," so that part is left for a dedicated follow-up rather than guessing at a design.

## Build Log 8 (completed)

### Analog clock corrections

- [x] Frame color fixed to flat `var(--clock-bg)` (black) always, both themes, both faces — the theme-aware `--clock-analog-frame` variable from Log 7 was removed. Verified: `rgb(0,0,0)` in both light and dark theme.
- [x] 12hr numerals reverted to r=34 (undoing the accidental r=28 move). Verified: "3" numeral now renders at x=84 (cx 50 + r 34), matching the original position exactly. 24hr numerals stay at r=37.5.
- [x] 24hr dark-theme contrast fixed: added `--clock-analog-day` (light `#fff`, dark `#8a8a8a`) and changed `--clock-analog-night` to dark `#4a4a4a` (was `#1a1a1a`, nearly identical to the `#222` hand color). Both the outer ring/12hr face and the 24hr inner circle's day-half now use `--clock-analog-day`, so the whole dark-theme face reads as appropriately gray rather than staying stark white, while the hands stay clearly visible against both halves — checked visually with the hands actually rendered on top, not just as flat swatches.

### Clock: timezone pill

- [x] Moved out of `.clock-digital` (which disappears in analog mode) into a new `.clock-date-stack` wrapper alongside the day/month/day-number, anchored to the bottom of the date column via `justify-content: space-between` on `.clock-date`. Now visible in both digital and analog modes — verified in both.

### Long-press modals: native text-selection bug

- [x] Fixed: extended `user-select: none` / `-webkit-touch-callout: none` / `touch-action: manipulation` to `.help-panel` (shared by all three overlays — help, clock options, weather options), not just the widgets themselves. Verified via computed style (`user-select: none` on the panel).

### Weather widget: corrected layer stack + testing panel

- [x] **Real bug found and fixed along the way:** the layer-stack correction initially had all the right computed styles (skin background, opacity, z-index all verified correct in the DOM) but rendered completely invisible — a plain white card regardless of settings. Root cause: `.weather-widget` had `position: relative` but no explicit `z-index`, so it never actually established its own stacking context; `.weather-skin`'s `z-index: -1` was resolving against some distant ancestor's stacking context instead of being scoped locally, placing it behind unrelated page content. Fixed by adding `z-index: 0` to `.weather-widget`. Re-verified visually after the fix — the gradient is now genuinely visible.
- [x] Removed the per-row opaque/semi-transparent scrims (`.weather-top`, `.weather-middle`, etc. no longer have their own background) — replaced with the correct 5-layer stack: white base (`.weather-widget`'s own background, now toggleable) → sky gradient (`.weather-skin`, opacity-controlled) → cloud cover (overlay + drifting clouds, already layered inside `.weather-skin`) → *(weather effects — not built, per item 5, left alone)* → data (text/icons, always topmost, no longer needs its own background to stay readable).
- [x] Testing panel built (`🧪 Testing Panel` button at the bottom of the page, clearly marked temporary): time override (scrub any time of day to preview the gradient), cloud % slider, white-background toggle, gradient opacity slider, and a text-outline toggle (medium gray, the readability idea from the last message) — all wired to `renderWeatherSkin()` and verified live: time override to 2am produces the exact flat `#020617` night color; white-bg off + opacity slider all confirmed via computed style; cloud slider at 80% produces exactly 8 clouds at 0.4 overlay opacity (matches the cloud%÷10 and cloud%÷2 formulas exactly).
- [x] Used the finished tool to actually look at the worst case (white bg off, night colors) — confirmed the readability problem is real: some text stays visible, some effectively disappears against near-black. This was expected and is intentionally *not* fixed in this pass — item 5 (condition-specific effects) and the broader text-color question are still open, now something that can actually be evaluated instead of guessed at.

## Build Log 9 (completed)

### Clock widget: timezone pill anchoring (correction)

- [x] Pill moved out of the `.clock-date` flex flow entirely — now a direct child of `.clock-widget`, `position: absolute; bottom: 6px; right: 8px;`, anchored to the widget's own bottom-right corner rather than the date column's. `.clock-widget` gained `position: relative` to scope it. `.clock-date`'s `justify-content` simplified from `space-between` (no longer meaningful with only one child) to `center`. Verified via computed style: `position: absolute`, `bottom: 6px`, `right: 8px`.

### Clock widget: missing border

- [x] Added `border: 1px solid var(--home-header-bg)` to `.clock-widget`, matching `.tile` and `.weather-widget`. Verified via computed style.

### Weather widget: temperature font color

- [x] `.weather-temp` now uses `color: var(--fg-muted)`, matching `.weather-unit`. Verified both compute to the same `rgb(107, 107, 107)`.

### Weather widget: cloud layer distribution + opacity

- [x] Clouds now spawn only within the top 50% of the widget (`top: 0%–50%`, was `10%–70%`), with size and speed both derived from vertical position instead of randomized independently: `f = topPct / 50`, `size = 2.5 - 1.5*f` rem, `duration = 17 + 43*f` seconds — top edge is 2.5x/17s (fastest), middle is 1x/60s (slowest), linear in between. Cloud count formula and horizontal drift left untouched. Opacity dropped from `0.9` to `0.8`. Verified programmatically: sampled 10 clouds at 100% cloud cover, every one matched the formula exactly and stayed within the 0%–50% band.

### New feature: automatic theme switching by local time

- [x] Built as opt-in, off by default (`themeAutoMode` in `localStorage`, starts unset/false). UI question from the queue resolved by long-pressing the theme-toggle button (same `attachLongPress` pattern as the clock/weather widgets) to open a new "Theme Options" overlay with a single "Automatic (day 7am–7pm / night 7pm–7am)" checkbox — no new global settings surface needed. When enabled, applies the correct theme immediately and schedules a `setTimeout` for the next 7:00 boundary (mirrors the `scheduleNextClockTick()` pattern) so it flips live without a reload. Manual-vs-auto conflict resolved as: a manual click on the toggle always wins and turns auto mode off (rather than being silently overridden at the next boundary) — this wasn't specified, so flagging the decision here in case it's not what's wanted. Verified with `page.clock`: auto-on at 2pm → light, auto-on at 10pm → dark, manual click while auto is on → auto flag clears to false.

### ~~Weather widget: cloud overlay / drifting clouds not rendering~~ (not a bug — confirmed)

- [x] Root cause confirmed by user: the "Live Condition Skin" toggle in Weather Options was simply off. No code issue, nothing was built.

## Build Log 10 (completed)

### Weather widget: dynamic (background-aware) text color

- [x] Built early — user asked for it ahead of the WeatherAPI work specifically to be able to test the white-base-vs-gradient question live rather than in the abstract. Implements the already-agreed design: black text on light/warm composited backgrounds, medium gray (`#808080`) on dark/near-black ones, hard cutoff (no crossfade), one widget-wide value (not per-row).
- [x] Composite is genuinely 3-layer as planned: base (white, or dark navy in dark theme, or transparent if the white-bg toggle is off — read via `getComputedStyle(weatherWidgetEl).backgroundColor` rather than hardcoded white, so it's correct under both themes and the toggle) → sky gradient average color (`lerpColor(sky.top, sky.bottom, 0.5)`, "one widget-wide color" resolved as the midpoint of the top-to-bottom gradient) at its opacity → cloud tint (`#4b5563`) at its own opacity, always layered on top when Live Condition Skin is on regardless of the gradient toggle. Standard WCAG relative luminance formula on the final composited RGB, threshold at `0.5` (`WX_TEXT_LUMINANCE_THRESHOLD` in script.js) picks black vs. gray.
- [x] Scope decision made during the build, not previously specified: only the *neutral/muted* text (wind/visibility/cloud, location, temp, hi/lo's "feels like", footer stats) is driven by the new `--wx-text-color` custom property. The deliberately-colored elements — hi (red)/lo (blue) semantic arrows, and the UV badge's severity colors — were left untouched, since overriding those would erase their own meaning rather than fix a readability problem. Flagging this in case "all the widget's text" was meant more literally.
- [x] When both `sunGradient` and `liveSkin` are off, `--wx-text-color` is removed entirely and every affected element falls back to the normal themed `var(--fg-muted)` via `var(--wx-text-color, var(--fg-muted))` — verified computed color returns to the exact theme value (`#6b6b6b`) with the property unset.
- [x] Verified live across scenarios: default state (white bg on, 18% opacity) → black; night + white-bg-on-18% → still black (white dominates at low opacity, as expected); night + white-bg-off (full gradient) → gray; midday + white-bg-off → landed right at the threshold edge (see note below); midday + 60% opacity white-bg-on, the exact case from the user's screenshot → black, confirmed by screenshot comparison. Dark theme confirmed pulling the actual dark navy `--surface` as the base (not literal white) — night + 18% opacity in dark theme correctly resolves to gray.
- [x] **Worth watching:** a saturated full-strength midday sky blue (`#4a90e2`/`#d1e8ff` averaged) computed to a relative luminance of ~0.48 — just under the 0.5 threshold, landing on gray rather than black, even though it visually reads as a fairly light blue. WCAG relative luminance weights blue very low (0.0722), so saturated blues can read "darker" by this formula than they look to the eye. The threshold (and possibly the luminance formula itself, e.g. switching to HSL lightness) is exactly what still needs live tuning via the testing panel, as already flagged — this is a concrete example of why.
- [x] The white-base-stays-in-the-design question is still not decided — this build doesn't resolve it, it's the tool for evaluating it. That decision is still open.

## Build Log 11 (completed)

### Weather widget: text-color threshold corrected (gray's own luminance, minus a margin)

- [x] `WX_TEXT_LUMINANCE_THRESHOLD` (script.js) is no longer a hardcoded `0.5` — it's now computed at load time as `relativeLuminance(hexToRgb(WX_TEXT_DARK)) - WX_TEXT_THRESHOLD_MARGIN`, with `WX_TEXT_THRESHOLD_MARGIN = 0.05` (starting value, tunable). Landed at ≈0.166. Verified: the saturated midday sky blue that was landing on gray under the old 0.5 threshold now correctly resolves to black; deep night still resolves to gray.

### Weather widget: larger drifting clouds now enter/exit fully offscreen regardless of size

- [x] Real per-cloud fix, not a bigger flat percentage: each cloud gets a `--cloud-w` CSS custom property set from its own measured `offsetWidth` (plus a 4px buffer) right after it's added to the DOM, and `.wx-skin-cloud`'s `left` plus the `wx-cloud-drift` keyframe now both use `calc(-1 * var(--cloud-w, 40px))` / `calc(100% + var(--cloud-w, 40px))` instead of the old flat `-15%`/`115%`. Verified programmatically across 10 clouds at 100% cover: every cloud's computed `--cloud-w` matched its actual rendered width + 4px, and every one's start position left its right edge safely negative (fully offscreen) regardless of size.

### Weather widget: cloud count formula rounds up below 10%

- [x] `Math.round(cloudPct / 10)` → `Math.floor(cloudPct / 10)`. Verified: 8% → 0 clouds, 15% → 1, 100% → 10, matching the "no clouds below 10%, one per 10%" rule exactly.

### Weather widget: re-randomize cloud height on each lap

- [x] Extracted the random top/size/duration generation into a `randomizeCloud(cloud)` helper, called once at creation and again from an `animationiteration` listener attached to each cloud — so every lap gets a fresh height (and correlated size/speed) instead of the same fixed lane forever. `--cloud-w` is recomputed inside the same helper, so a respawned cloud's offscreen entry width stays correct for its new size too. Verified by dispatching synthetic `animationiteration` events: top/size/duration all changed on each call, and `--cloud-w` tracked the new rendered width correctly afterward.
- [x] ~~The "does changing `animation-duration` mid-loop cause a visible flicker" question flagged when this was queued is resolved structurally~~ — **this turned out to be wrong.** It is visible, and the actual cause wasn't duration — see the queue fix below.

## Build Log 12 (completed)

### Settings menu built; auto-theme toggle moved out of the long-press overlay

- [x] Per user's correction ("No, it will be removed"): the long-press-triggered "Theme Options" overlay from Build Log 9 is gone entirely — no more `attachLongPress` on the theme-toggle button. In its place, a real (minimal) Settings overlay (`#settings-overlay`) opens from the profile button, replacing its old "coming soon" placeholder. The "Automatic (day 7am–7pm / night 7pm–7am)" checkbox now lives there, under a "Theme" section. Verified: profile click opens it with the checkbox present, the old `theme-options-overlay` no longer exists in the DOM, and long-pressing the theme button no longer opens anything (falls through to an ordinary click/toggle).

### Theme change instantly repaints the clock and weather widget

- [x] Added `syncThemeDependentUI()` (calls `updateClock()` + `renderWeatherSkin()`), called after every *runtime* theme change — the manual toggle click, the auto-theme scheduled switch, and toggling auto-mode on/off in Settings. Deliberately **not** called from the initial synchronous theme application at page load, since `updateClock`/`renderWeatherSkin` reference `const`s (`clockSettings`, `weatherSettings`, etc.) declared later in the same file — calling them that early would throw (temporal dead zone) before those declarations run. Verified: analog clock face fill colors change immediately on toggle (no minute wait), and — after isolating from `sunGradient`'s independent effect on the composite, which also correctly depends on `sky` rather than theme — the weather widget's `--wx-text-color` flips black↔gray immediately when `sunGradient` is off and only `liveSkin`'s cloud tint is in play. Also verified reloading with auto-theme mode already persisted true throws no init-time error.

### White background off automatically whenever a Visual Flourish is on

- [x] Resolves the long-tabled white-base question. `renderWeatherSkin()` now computes `hasFlourish = weatherSettings.sunGradient || weatherSettings.liveSkin` once and drives all three formerly-testing-panel-only behaviors from it: the `no-white-bg` class, the gradient's opacity (always full-strength `1` now, since white base can no longer coexist with it), and the text-color composite base. When there's no sky gradient but `liveSkin` is still on, the composite correctly falls back to the *page's* own background (reading through the now-transparent widget) rather than misreading the widget's own transparent computed color as black.
- [x] Per user's answer ("Go ahead and remove them"), the testing panel's manual white-background toggle and gradient-opacity slider are gone — removed from both the HTML ("Sky Layer" section deleted) and `weatherTestState`. Verified: neither `#test-whitebg-toggle` nor `#test-opacity-slider` exist anymore; both flourishes off → no `no-white-bg` class; either one on → class present and gradient opacity reads `1`.

### ~~Cloud respawn jump bug fixed~~ (incomplete — see queue for the real fix)

- [x] `randomizeCloud()` split: the random negative `animation-delay` is now set exactly once, at creation, right after the initial `randomizeCloud()` call (reading the duration it just set). The `animationiteration` respawn handler calls `randomizeCloud()` alone, which now only ever touches `top`/`fontSize`/`animationDuration`/`--cloud-w` — never delay again. Verified: dispatching a synthetic `animationiteration` event leaves `animationDelay` unchanged while `top`/`animationDuration` do change, confirming the fix without needing to wait out a real multi-second animation cycle.
- [x] **This was only half the bug.** User reported clouds still jitter/jump after this shipped. Re-isolated with the same repro methodology and confirmed: reassigning `animation-duration` alone (delay left untouched, fixed at creation, exactly as shipped) reproduces the identical teleportation — the browser recalculates a running animation's current cycle position as elapsed-time ÷ duration, so changing *either* delay or duration on a live animation can jump it, not just delay. Repro: 19 rogue iteration events in 4 seconds (durations averaging ~1s, should be ~4-6), computed `left` landing anywhere from -39px to 233px on a 300px box — matches "jitters around and jumps in randomly" exactly. See the Build Queue entry below for the actual fix and its own verification.

### Live Condition Skin: full animation system built (from uploaded `weatherconditionskindetailedspec.md`)

- [x] All 10 states from the spec, driven by a single `<canvas class="weather-skin-precip">` plus a `<div class="weather-skin-flash">`, both created once and repositioned via `appendChild` on every `renderWeatherSkin()` pass to keep the required DOM/paint order (gradient → cloud overlay → **precip canvas** → floating clouds → **flash** → widget content) — verified directly via DOM inspection. One continuous `requestAnimationFrame` loop (`stepConditionSkin`) does near-zero work when nothing is selected.
  - **Light/Heavy Rain:** 17 / 45 diagonal streaks, heavy falls faster and darker-toned. Thunderstorm reuses the heavy-rain streak system as its base, per spec.
  - **Snow:** 25 flakes, slow fall, per-flake independently-phased horizontal sway (sine wave, randomized phase/speed per flake, not synced).
  - **Hail:** 30 pellets, fast near-vertical fall, **required bounce-on-impact** implemented as a small state machine per particle (`fall` → `bounce`, a brief upward hop via a half-sine easing, fading out — then respawns at top) — this was the one explicitly non-optional visual trait in the spec and got dedicated per-particle state rather than being folded into the generic fall logic.
  - **Thunderstorm lightning flash:** randomized 8–20s interval, 100–150ms duration, 20–30% opacity, one at a time — verified the *first* flash fires almost immediately (by design: its internal timer starts at 0, so the very first qualifying frame satisfies "time to flash"), confirmed directly rather than waiting out a full interval.
  - **Clear Day / Clear Night flourishes:** 5 slowly-rotating translucent rays from the top-right corner (~4min/rotation) and 15–25 independently-twinkling stars (per-star randomized phase), respectively. **Known simplification, not in the original spec:** selecting these does *not* auto-force the time-of-day override — they layer onto whatever gradient state (real time or the existing time-override control) is already showing. Selecting "Clear Night" against an actual daytime gradient will render barely-visible white star dots; combine with the existing time-override control to see it properly. Flagging this as a deliberate scope simplification, not an oversight.
  - **Fog/Mist:** 2–3 large (35–50% of widget width) very-low-opacity (14%) soft radial-gradient blobs drifting horizontally, wrapping at the edges.
  - **Partly Cloudy / Overcast:** no dedicated code, per spec — the picker entries exist for completeness but do nothing beyond what the existing cloud-cover system (already on whenever `liveSkin` is active) already renders.
  - **Compound conditions:** driven by a `Set` of active keys (`weatherTestState.conditionSkins`), not a fixed enum — any combination layers automatically since each particle type/effect just checks `c.has('...')` independently. Verified Thunderstorm + Hail together: both particle types draw simultaneously and the flash still fires on its own schedule on top.
- [x] **Placement, per user's correction — overrides what the uploaded doc said:** the "Preview Condition Skins" picker (10 checkboxes, multi-select) lives in the existing temporary `🧪 Testing Panel`, not the Weather Options long-press menu — it's explicitly temporary and will be removed with the rest of that panel once real API integration lands, not kept as a permanent feature. The reset button clears all 10 checkboxes along with the panel's other controls.
- [x] Verified via canvas pixel inspection (not just visual screenshots) that the canvas actually draws non-transparent pixels when a condition is active and clears fully to transparent when none are selected or `liveSkin` is off — plus screenshots confirming rain, snow, hail, and fog are visually distinguishable from each other as the spec intended (streaks vs. dots vs. pellets vs. soft blobs).

## Build Log 13 (completed)

### Live Condition Skin: cloud overlay derived from sky brightness

- [x] Replaced the fixed `#4b5563` gray entirely. `computeCloudTint(now, conditionSkins)` (script.js) computes the current sky-average color (`lerpColor(sky.top, sky.bottom, 0.5)`, same convention already used for the text-color composite), applies `multiplier = 1 + (daytime ? -dayBasePct : +nightBasePct)/100 - conditionShiftPct/100`, and scales each RGB channel by it (clamped 0–255). `isDaytime(now)` reuses the exact existing `SUNRISE_SEC ± TWILIGHT_HALF` / `SUNSET_SEC ± TWILIGHT_HALF` boundary — no new threshold introduced. `WX_CLOUD_TINT_RGB` is gone; the text-color composite calc now reuses the same `cloudTint.rgb` the overlay itself paints with.
- [x] Opacity now branches day/night: `cloudOverlayOpacity()` returns `cloudPct/2/100` by day (unchanged), `cloudPct/100` by night (new, double the day rate) — not condition-dependent, matching the spec.
- [x] Verified against the user's own worked examples exactly: Day + Heavy Rain + 40% cloud → readout showed "Day · 40% of sky · 20% opacity"; Night + Thunderstorm + 70% cloud → "Night · 100% of sky · 70% opacity" (the coincidental case where Thunderstorm's −40% exactly cancels the night's +40% base). Computed overlay background/opacity matched the readout in both cases.
- [x] All 5 constants (day base, night base, light/heavy rain shift, thunderstorm shift) live in a mutable `WX_CLOUD_TUNABLES` object, defaults matching the spec (40/40/10/20/40).

### Testing panel: sliders and live display for the cloud brightness formula

- [x] 5 range sliders added to the existing "Preview Condition Skins" section (not a new section, since they only matter while previewing) — each writes straight into `WX_CLOUD_TUNABLES` and re-renders immediately. A live readout line shows the current Day/Night branch, resulting brightness (% of sky), and resulting opacity (%), plus a small color swatch and hex value showing the actual computed tint. Reset button restores all 5 to spec defaults. Verified: dragging the day-base slider changed the readout's brightness % immediately, matching the new value.

### Weather widget: cloud opacity increased to 90%

- [x] `.wx-skin-cloud`'s `opacity` changed from `0.8` to `0.9`. Verified via computed style.

### Cloud respawn: real fix shipped — element replacement instead of mutation

- [x] The Build Log 12 fix only addressed `animation-delay`; user reported clouds still jittering. Root cause fully isolated: reassigning `animation-duration` alone on a running animation causes the identical jump (confirmed via the same repro methodology — 19 rogue iterations in 4s, positions scattered -39px to 233px). The real fix: `spawnCloud(oldCloud)` now creates a brand-new `<span>` and uses `weatherSkin.replaceChild()` to swap it in at the same DOM position (preserving the fixed layer order), rather than mutating the existing element's animation properties. Fresh elements just start a clean animation with nothing to reinterpret. The initial creation batch still gets a staggered negative `animation-delay` (so N clouds don't start in lockstep); respawns via the `animationiteration` listener get none, by design.
- [x] Verified directly (not just via the isolated repro this time): dispatched a real `animationiteration` event on a live cloud in the actual app and confirmed the DOM node's identity changes (a JS marker set on the original element does not carry over to whatever `.wx-skin-cloud` exists afterward), the original node is no longer in the DOM, and the new node's `left` position exactly matches `-1 × --cloud-w` (fully offscreen, as designed).

## Build Queue

Not yet implemented — queued for whenever it's relevant. All blocked on the same thing: the live WeatherAPI.com integration doesn't exist yet, this widget is still entirely placeholder data.

- [ ] 15-minute staleness-based weather refresh (cache fetch + timestamp in `localStorage`, refetch only when ≥15 min stale).
- [ ] Geolocation: `navigator.geolocation` for real coordinates (must work globally, not US-only), with a sensible fallback if access is declined.
- [ ] Timezone abbreviation: true local timezone of the detected location via WeatherAPI's `location.tz_id`, never UTC/device-home, UTC-offset fallback only if no standard abbreviation applies.
- [ ] Full live data pull: feels-like, wind, visibility, cloud cover, humidity, dew point, UV, moon phase (all 8 phases), sunrise/sunset, severe alerts, hourly forecast via `/forecast.json?days=1&alerts=yes`.
- [ ] Auto-selecting the active Live Condition Skin state(s) from real API condition data (rather than the manual testing-panel picker) — the animations themselves are already built and don't need the API; only this final wiring step does.
