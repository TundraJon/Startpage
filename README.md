## Status

Foundation in progress, per `homepage-build-spec-v7`:

- [x] Header (theme toggle, title, help/profile icons)
- [x] Search bar (Google/Bing toggle)
- [x] Home category (always-expanded bento layout, clock + weather widgets, core tiles)
- [x] Accordion category system (collapsible, multi-open, stripe-colored headers) with a few sample sections
- [ ] Weather widget wired to a live data source (currently placeholder data)
- [ ] Clock/weather long-press customization menus
- [ ] Add/edit tiles and categories (help walkthrough, drag/reorg, etc.)
- [ ] Personalization (colors, profile photo, per-device local storage of layout)

Theme and category expand/collapse state already persist per-device via `localStorage`.

## Build Log (completed)

Reported after reviewing the v8 pass live, built in the following pass.

- [x] Home category header bar: was rendering ~2x too tall — root cause was the `<h2>` tag's browser-default margin (not padding); normalized `.category-name` margin/font-size so it now matches the thin header height of every other category.
- [x] Clock widget: hour and minute digits doubled in size (1.9rem → 3.8rem).
- [x] Weather widget: current temperature number and condition emoji doubled in size (1.8rem → 3.6rem).
- [x] Weather widget: high temp shown in red, low temp shown in blue.
- [x] Weather widget: feels-like icon now switches direction — 🌡️ when feels-like is warmer than actual temp, 🌬️ when cooler.
- [x] Weather widget: the four bottom-row icon+number items (humidity, dew point, moon phase, UV) sized up 1.2x (0.7rem → 0.84rem).
- [x] Tiles: background switched from the off-white page background to pure white (`--surface`).
- [x] Tiles: added a border matching the Home header banner color (`--home-header-bg`) — same CSS variable as the banner, so it'll track automatically once Home color personalization is built.
- [x] Weather widget: background switched to pure white (`--surface`), same fix as the tiles.

## Build Log 2 (completed)

- [x] Clock widget: date stack (day-of-week, month, day-numeral) font size increased 1.3x (0.75rem → 0.975rem).
- [x] Weather widget: high, low, and feels-like text increased 1.2x, sharing a rule with the description text so both land at the same size (0.7rem → 0.84rem).
- [x] Weather widget: condition description text increased 1.2x, same rule as above.
- [x] Weather widget: sample condition text changed to "Light Thunderstorm".
- [x] Sample category tiles (News/Shopping/Entertainment): added a 5th tile to each — AP News, Costco, Hulu.
- [x] Home category's row-3 tiles: added a 5th tile (Google Calendar) alongside Gmail/Translate/Maps/USPS.
- [x] Weather widget: added a border matching the Home banner color (`--home-header-bg`), same treatment as the regular tiles.
- [x] Tile favicons: increased from 60% to 80% fill; tightened tile padding/gap (4px → 2px) so the label text still has room at the larger icon size.
- [x] Weather widget: top row (wind/visibility/cloud extras + location text) increased 1.2x (0.7rem → 0.84rem).
- [x] Clock widget: date stack swapped to static test values "Wednesday" / "September" / "20" (no longer live — the day/month were live-updating fields tied to `updateClock()`, now hardcoded so the long-form test values persist). **Result: it doesn't fit.** At the new 1.3x size, "Wednesday" and "September" both overflow the date column's width and wrap/clip against the widget's height — see screenshot state, this will need either an abbreviated form, a smaller font, or a wider date column once you've had a look.
- [x] Timezone pill: removed from the weather widget's top row; moved to the clock widget, centered under the displayed time (inside `.clock-face`, so it inherits the active color scheme via `currentColor`), font size matched to the AM/PM indicator (0.7rem).

## Build Log 3 (completed)

- [x] Clock widget restructured: digital time area (`.clock-face`) is now genuinely square (`aspect-ratio: 1/1`, sized to 78% of the widget's height, centered) instead of a 62%-width rectangle — verified in-browser at 147.7×147.7 equal width/height. This frees up space for a future analog face with the same footprint. Date stack reverted to abbreviated only ("Thu"/"Aug"/"20"), back to live-updating (short/long toggle and long-form idea dropped), font size back to 1x (0.75rem), shrunk to fit its content and pushed snug against the right edge (`margin-left: auto` + 6px padding). Verified the day-numeral is centered exactly under the month abbreviation (both measured at the same x-center in a live render).
- [x] Tile favicons: 80% → 75%.
- [x] Weather widget sample location changed to "Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, NM" — confirmed it wraps to two lines within its half of the top row without breaking layout.
- [x] Weather widget top row: restructured to a strict 50/50 split (`flex: 0 0 50%` each side) — extras above the temp, location (right-aligned) above the condition emoji.
- [x] Weather icons vs. text sizing split apart: each icon+value pair (top row and footer row) is now two separate elements, icon at 1.2x (`.wx-icon`) and value at 1x (`.wx-val`) — verified via computed styles (13.44px vs. 11.2px, exactly 1.2:1).
- [x] Weather sample condition text changed to WeatherAPI code 1201, "Moderate or heavy freezing rain" — confirmed it wraps to two lines at 1x without breaking the row.
- [x] Weather hi/low/feels-like + description row: reverted to 1x (0.7rem) — verified via computed style.
- [x] Category gaps replaced with a 1px hairline border (`border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border)`, no bottom border on the last category) instead of the old 10px margin — page is visibly more compact now, categories sit flush against each other.
- [~] Clock time-vs-pill vertical spacing: not separately tuned — the square-face restructure above changes this spacing as a side effect (face is now centered via `align-items: center` rather than stretched full-height), but I did not specifically verify it now sits "just a little over" the pill as asked. Worth a look on the live site — flag it again if the gap still isn't right and I'll adjust it directly rather than as a side effect of other changes.

## Build Log 4 (completed)

- [x] Weather widget bottom row: `.weather-hilo` and `.weather-desc` now each constrained to exactly 50% width (`flex: 0 0 50%`), description right-justified. Verified: hi/lo/feels-like now renders on a single line (13px tall, was 25px/double before) since it's no longer being squeezed to 34%; description wraps to two lines within its own half without affecting the other side.
- [x] Clock scheduling replaced: `setInterval(updateClock, 1000 * 10)` is gone. Now renders immediately on load, then computes ms-to-next-minute (`(60 - seconds) * 1000 - milliseconds`) and uses `setTimeout` to fire exactly on the minute boundary, rescheduling itself the same way each time (no drift-prone flat interval). Verified the ms-to-next-minute math against edge cases (:00.000 → 60000ms, :45.500 → 14500ms, :59.999 → 1ms) — all correct.

## Build Log 5 (completed)

- [x] Weather options menu — "Units & Core Info" section reordered to Temperature, Wind speed (unit), Wind Speed, Visibility, Cloud Cover %, Feels Like, Moon Phase, UV Index. Moon Phase moved here from "Visual Flourishes" (which now just holds Sunrise/Sunset Gradient and Live Condition Skin). Dropped the redundant word "display" from the three toggle labels. No JS/CSS changes needed — the toggle wiring is `data-toggle-setting`/`data-toggle` attribute-driven, not order-dependent, so this was a pure markup reorder. Verified the new row order and that the Moon Phase toggle still correctly hides its footer element from its new position.

### Weather Widget Phase 2 — build order item 1 (completed)

Resolved conflict: the spec's stacked wind/visibility/cloud layout **overrides** the previous horizontal build (confirmed with user 2026-08-20).

- [x] Top-left zone (wind/visibility/cloud): switched from horizontal to stacked — emoji on top, value below, three independent mini-columns (`.wx-stack`). Each independently toggleable; `[data-toggle]` + `hidden` attribute (with an explicit `.wx-stack[hidden]{display:none}` override, same fix pattern as the earlier help-overlay bug) — verified via computed styles.
- [x] Feels-like: only displays when the diff from actual temp is ±3°F or more (cold-case emoji 🌬️ already matched the spec, no change needed there). Verified: hides/shows correctly via the toggle, and the sample data (diff of 4°F) correctly shows.
- [x] Long-press options menu built: 3 sections in the spec's order (Units & Core Info, Safety, Visual Flourishes), all 11 controls, opened via a custom long-press gesture (pointerdown + 550ms hold, cancels on move/release) rather than the browser's native context menu. All settings persist to `localStorage` (`weatherSettings`) and were verified to survive a full page reload.
- [x] Temperature unit tap-vs-persistent split: long-press menu F/C selection is the persistent default (saved + reapplied on load); tapping the °F/°C symbol directly is a temporary peek that does not touch the stored setting. Verified directly: tapped to peek at °C, then opened the long-press menu — it still showed °F as the active/persistent selection, confirming the two are properly decoupled.
- [x] Wind speed MPH/KPH: added as a persistent menu setting (source value stored in mph, converted for display) — not explicitly required for item 1 but natural to include alongside the temp unit work since it follows the identical pattern.

## Build Log 6 (completed)

### Clock Widget Phase 2 (from `clock-widget-phase2-spec`)

No conflicts with existing implementation at the time this was reviewed. One genuine internal contradiction *within the spec itself* on 24hr face orientation ("6/18 sit at horizontal left/right" vs. "6 sits at the bottom") — resolved with the user: **24 at top, 12 at bottom, 6 at right, 18 at left** (matches the math for 24 evenly-spaced positions, the ASCII diagram's left/right row, and how real 24-hour accessibility clocks like the Chicago Lighthouse reference are actually laid out).

- [x] Long-press menu on the clock widget (`attachLongPress` — refactored out of the weather widget's identical implementation into a shared helper, both now use it): Digital/Analog segmented selector plus an always-visible live preview area below it — 4 color-scheme swatches (each a small live-updating digital clock) when Digital is selected, or a single live analog face preview when Analog is selected. Selecting an option applies immediately (same instant-apply pattern as the weather menu) and updates the preview so you can see the result without closing the modal.
- [x] 12hr/24hr toggle, shared between modes: in digital, adds/removes the AM/PM indicator; in analog, switches face geometry. Both settings persist to `localStorage` (`clockSettings`) — verified surviving a full reload.
- [x] Analog 12hr face: white background, hour + minute hands, ticks at all 12 positions, only 3/6/9/12 printed, no shading. Rendered via SVG, generated in JS (`renderAnalogFace`).
- [x] Analog 24hr face: outer ring white throughout with 24 ticks + 6/12/18/24 numerals; inner circle split along the horizontal 6–18 axis, gray top / white bottom; hour hand at half speed (one rotation per 24h), minute hand normal. Verified precisely at a mocked midnight (00:00) — hour hand renders pointing exactly to the top (the 24 position), confirming both the orientation and the rotation math are correct.
- [x] Fixed a real browser bug hit along the way: setting `.hidden = false` on an `<svg>` element updates the IDL property but does **not** reliably remove the actual `hidden` content attribute in this Chromium build (confirmed via isolated test — the property read back `false` while `getAttribute('hidden')` still returned `""`). Since the CSS visibility rule targets the attribute via `[hidden]`, this silently kept the analog face invisible even though the "hidden" property said otherwise. Fixed by using explicit `setAttribute('hidden','')`/`removeAttribute('hidden')` for the SVG element specifically, rather than relying on the `.hidden` property.
- [x] Digital mode layout confirmed unchanged/correct, per the spec's own note that this section just restates what's already built.

## Build Queue

Not yet implemented — queued for whenever it's relevant.

- [ ] Weather (blocked on live data being wired up — WeatherAPI.com integration doesn't exist yet, this widget is still static placeholder data): 15-minute staleness-based refresh, not a plain interval. Cache the fetched data plus a fetch timestamp in `localStorage`. On load, check the cached timestamp's age: if ≥15 minutes old (or no cache exists yet), fetch immediately; otherwise render the cached data with no network call. If the page stays open past the 15-minute mark in one sitting, a timer refetches at that point. This matters because typical visits are short (well under 5 minutes) and jump between pages, so staleness needs to be tracked across visits via the stored timestamp — a plain "fetch on load, wait 15 min" interval would rarely ever actually refire within a single visit.

### Weather Widget Phase 2 — remaining (build order items 2–3)

- [ ] Severe Weather Alerts: scrolling/marquee ticker across the full-width bottom row (same space as humidity/dew point/moon/UV), looping until tapped to dismiss. Reappears if the alert's content changes while active (compare content/ID, not just presence) even if a similar-looking one was already dismissed. Also reappears automatically 2 hours after dismissal if still active, repeating every 2 hours for as long as it stays active. Independent of the 4 toggleable bottom-row items — overrides that row's space temporarily when active, regardless of their on/off state.
- [ ] Bottom row (humidity/dew point/moon/UV): when all 4 are toggled off, the row should render as blank space, not collapse to zero height — needed so the severe alert ticker always has consistent space to appear in. (Depends on the toggle menu above existing first.)
- [ ] Live Condition Skin: lightweight background animation per condition (rain/snow/thunderstorm/clear day/cloudy/clear night — implementer has creative latitude on exact style), plus cloud-cover-driven dynamics layered on top: gray overlay opacity = cloud% ÷ 2 (verified examples: 50%→25% opacity, 80%→40%, 100%→50%); floating ☁️ emojis, one per 10% cloud cover, each independently randomized 1x–2x size, drifting left to right, speed scaling linearly with size (1x = base/slowest speed, tune empirically during build — no fixed px/s target given). Must be able to render simultaneously with the sunrise/sunset gradient (gradient = base color, condition skin layers on top). Use lightweight CSS/Canvas — this may sit open/idle on a phone for extended periods, so avoid battery-draining effects.
- [ ] Sunrise/sunset gradient: implement the exact keyframe/interpolation logic from the v8 spec (45-min-each-side twilight window, separate sunrise/sunset color keyframe tables, linear RGB lerp between nearest keyframes) — not yet built.
- [ ] Geolocation: use `navigator.geolocation` to get the user's real coordinates (must work anywhere globally, not US-only — household travels to Brazil regularly), pass coordinates directly to WeatherAPI.com. Needs a sensible fallback/message if location access is declined (e.g. manual entry or a clear "location access needed" message).
- [ ] Timezone abbreviation: must reflect the true local timezone of the detected location (e.g. BRT in Brazil, JST in Japan) — never UTC and never the device's home timezone. Derive from WeatherAPI's `location.tz_id` (IANA identifier) rather than calculating from raw UTC offset (offset-only math doesn't handle DST correctly across different countries' rules). Fall back to a raw UTC-offset string only if no standard abbreviation applies.
- [ ] Full data pull once live: feels-like, wind, visibility, cloud cover, humidity, dew point, UV, moon phase (all 8 phases + abbreviations, not just the current static "Full"), sunrise/sunset, severe alerts, hourly forecast — via `/forecast.json?days=1&alerts=yes` (confirm exact params against current API docs at build time). UV color bands and moon phase emoji/abbreviation mapping already match the spec in the current placeholder implementation — no change needed there, just needs real data wired in.
